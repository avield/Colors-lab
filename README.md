# Colors-lab
A working example of building a simple web application with a LAMP stack. Users can log in to a site and add or search for colors on a MySQL database.

# Steps
- Purchase web domain: dahamancop4331.xyz
- Rent web hosting from Digital Ocean
- Create and deploy LAMP Droplet on Digital Ocean
- Synchronize github account with LAMP server so all updates to github are deployed to the server automatically
    - This means html files are left in the root directory as the root mirrors /var/www/html on the server
    - workflows directory with a yml file
- Set up MySQL Database according to ERD (found in Documentations folder)
- Create Back End:
    - API end points using PHP (LAMPAPI folder)
- Create Front End:
    - HTML files (index.html and color.html in root directory)
    - CSS files for appearance (CSS, images folders)
    - Javascript files to communicate with API points
